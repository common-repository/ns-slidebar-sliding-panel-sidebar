Add a dynamic slide out sidebar panel to any theme with built-in site search and a widget area.  

== Description ==

This is a theme add-on feature that creates a dynamic, expanding Search button in the top right corner of the page. The Search button expands into a Search field and sliding widget side panel that contains a widget area for widgets. The side panel also displays search results above any widgets that are there.  

= Features = 
* Automatically add a sliding panel and content area for widgets to your site
* Integrate unobtrusive site search onto every page of your site through the slide out sidebar
* Add any content to your dynamic sliding sidebar via its built-in widget area
* Customize all the settings for the sidebar like button text, image, width, and search results properties
* Includes several hooks for developers to extend it further

= Settings Allow you to Control  =
* Trigger Width (width of the area that triggers the panel to slide out)
* Trigger Text (what the button should say - usually something like "Search")
* Trigger Image (an image to use beside the Trigger text)
* More Text (text to use to for loading additional results)
* Results per Page (how many results to show at a time before the More Text)
* Excerpt Length (how many characters of the content to include per search result)
